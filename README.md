This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is the psychological theory that we must attend to certain needs before we can focus on others. First comes taking care of our physiology, then safety, love and belonging, and esteem. If we get that far, we're able to work on self-actualization -  or so the theory goes. 

Here's a new theory: we need fun.

This app is for all of us who are working hard every day to make ends meet and make our aspirations reality. This app is for all of us who say "We should do ...! It would be so fun!" and then never get around to doing it. 

Keep working hard. But have a little fun, too. It's good for you.

Full README to come!
